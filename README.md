# `PIXterm` - *draw images in your ANSI terminal with true color*

**`PIXterm`** ***shows images directly in your terminal***, recreating the pixels through a combination of [ANSI character background color](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors) and the [unicode lower half block element](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).

The conversion process runs fast because it is parallelized in all available logical CPUs.

Supported image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP.

#### Requirements
Your terminal emulator must be support *true color* feature in order to display image colors in a right way. In addition, you must use a monospaced font that includes the lower half block unicode character `â–„ (U+2584)`. I personally recommend [Envy Code R](http://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released). It's the nice font that shows in the screenshots.


#### Dependencies

All dependencies are directly included in the project via [Go's Vendor Directories](http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories). You should not do anything else. Anyway, if you want to get the dependencies manually, project uses the [Glide Vendor Package Management](http://glide.sh). Follow its instructions.

#### About

**`PIXterm`** is a terminal toy application that I made to exercise my skills on Go programming language. If you have not tried this language yet, please give it a try! It's easy, fast and very well organized. You'll not regret :D

*This application it's inspired by the clever [termpix](http://github.com/hopey-dishwasher/termpix), implemented in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org).*
